## 🧱 Construction Notes

### Base Platform
- Made from 2×4 framing
- Dimensions: 132" × 20"
- Receives baseboard wrap for finished look
- Slight overhang planned (~0.75") for MDF edges

### Lower Box (Deep Display)
- Height: 36" including platform
- Fixed verticals at 36", 96", and sides (creating 3' – 5' – 3' bays)
- Fixed shelves only (no dados)
- Front trim and rear cleats for sag resistance
- Interior lighting routed into underside of top trim

### Upper Box (Shallow Display)
- Height: 72"
- Depth: 12"
- Built without a bottom panel (sits directly on lower box top)
- Vertical dividers create 4 bays (~33" each)
- All shelves fixed
- Front edge gets same trim + integrated lighting

---

## 💡 Lighting

- LED puck or strip lights to be routed into top trim of each shelf
- Cord route hidden behind trim, exits at back near outlet
- Power run through interior with hidden white raceway

---

## 🎨 Aesthetic Elements

- Matching molding on all front edges for a built-in look
- Faux countertop trim on lower box for depth illusion
- Baseboard wraps platform for smooth floor transition
- Optional crown molding at top if desired

---

## 🧮 Materials Summary (to be finalized)

- MDF: 3–4 full 4x8 sheets for backs, sides, and shelves
- Long MDF boards for sides (if available): 1×12×10' or similar
- 2×4s: For platform and bracing
- Trim: 1×2, 1×3, crown, baseboard
- Lighting: LED strips or pucks + driver
- Screws, glue, filler, paint

---

## 📦 Next Steps

- Model in Fusion 360
- Cut plan optimization
- Confirm final set dimensions (Star Destroyer, Republic Cruiser, Falcon)
- Add placeholder block dimensions for UCS sets
- Finalize lighting and outlet routing

## 📝 Notes

- Entire build is designed to be **modular and movable**, not a permanent wall fixture
- No dados, no adjustable shelving — strength > flexibility
- If MDF height limits persist, break lower box sides into two stacked sheets
