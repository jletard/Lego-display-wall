# LEGO Display Wall

This project documents the design and construction of a two-part built-in-style LEGO Star Wars display wall using MDF and 2×4 framing, with custom lighting, shelf spacing, and UCS ship fitment in mind.

## Final Dimensions

- **Total Width:** 132" (11 feet)
- **Total Height:** 108" (9 feet, including base)
- **Lower Box (Deep Base):**
  - Height: 36"
  - Depth: 20"
  - Width: 132"
  - Center bay: 60" wide for UCS Star Destroyer and Republic Cruiser
- **Upper Box (Shallower Top):**
  - Height: 72"
  - Depth: 12"
  - Width: 132"
  - Split into 4 vertical bays for display variety
- **Base Platform:**
  - Constructed from 2×4s
  - Footprint: 132" × 20"
  - Baseboard trim planned for a built-in look

## Construction Notes

- Shelves will be fixed, not adjustable, for structural strength
- Lower box acts like a deep kitchen counter for Falcon display
- Front trim and hidden rear cleat/back support will prevent sagging
- Lighting will be routed into upper trim for downward illumination
- Units built in two stackable parts for easier transport and assembly
